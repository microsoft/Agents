Current Date: Friday, June 28, 2025
Weather Data: Temperature: 72°F, Condition: Partly Cloudy, Humidity: 65%

Response:
{
    "contentType": "Text",
    "content": "Hi! The weather in Seattle today (Friday, June 28, 2025) is quite nice! 🌤️ It's currently 72°F with partly cloudy skies and 65% humidity. Perfect weather for a walk outside!"
}
